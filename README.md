🛠️ Streamlit Hydraulic Dashboard
Predictive maintenance for hydraulic systems using sensor data, XGBoost modeling, and an interactive Streamlit app.

📦 Project Overview
This end-to-end machine learning project enables early detection of hydraulic failures—such as pump leakage or valve issues—using real-world-like sensor data from industrial systems. It helps reduce downtime and increase equipment reliability through intelligent monitoring and batch predictions.

Built with:

Python, pandas, XGBoost, SHAP

Streamlit for interactive dashboard deployment

🏭 Industry Context
Hydraulic systems are widely used in automotive, aerospace, and manufacturing. Failures like accumulator pressure loss or cooler degradation can lead to unexpected shutdowns and costly repairs.

By processing time-series data from pressure, temperature, vibration, and flow sensors, this project helps maintenance teams anticipate faults before they occur.

🔍 Key Features
✅ Load and preprocess over 20 raw .txt sensor files
✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
✅ Extract cycle-level statistical features (~49 total)
✅ Train 5 supervised models (regression and classification)
✅ Apply SHAP for interpretability
✅ Build and deploy a web-based dashboard via Streamlit
✅ Support batch .csv uploads and download predictions

🎯 Performance Metrics
Target	Type	Score
Cooler Condition	Regression	RMSE: 4.94
Accumulator Pressure	Regression	RMSE: 3.17
Valve Condition	Classification	Accuracy: 98.4%
Pump Leakage	Classification	Accuracy: 99.7%

💡 SHAP Explainability
SHAP values were computed for each trained model to understand feature contributions.

Key insights:

pressure_skew, volume_flow_std, and efficiency_kurtosis had strong predictive value

SHAP summary plots provided transparent model behavior
